Scene 6 (25-32 sec) â€“ The Cinematic Standoff

    The kneeling man now stands tall, his chest heaving, eyes locked onto the stunned politician.
    He tilts the covered sword near his head, a symbolic gesture of defiance.
    A silence grips the room, the rowdies exchanging nervous glances.
    The camera zooms into his intense gaze, as the screen cuts to black.

important note: the image in the left is the politician and image in the right is the man on knee
